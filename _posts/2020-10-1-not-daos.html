<p>Success of an org depends on its:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Decision Velocity</li>
  <li>Decision Quality</li>
  <!-- <li>Decision Bandwidth</li> -->
</ol>

<p class="b-ws-top">DAOs in their current form suffer from a <a href="https://nav.al/principal-agent">principle-agent</a> problem.</p>
<p>They work well for <a href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1316292844156411905">simple low-velocity coordination</a> within a group of principals.</p>
<p>Not so much for <a href="https://decrypt.co/37995/exclusive-yfi-andre-cronje-broke-quitting-defi">complex high-velocity coordination</a> with a multi-variate group of principals and agents.</p>
<p class="b-ws-top">There are 4 kinds of people in each team:</p>
<ol>
	<li>People who don’t care for success of the business.</li>
	<li>People who care about business success when the ball is rolling.</li>
	<li>People who care about business success (even) when the ball gets dropped.</li>
	<li>People who care about business success irrespective of if the ball exists (or will exist) or not.</li>
</ol>

<p>#1 need to be fired. #2 are short-term agents.</p>
<p>#3 are long-term agents and need to be empowered. #4 are principals.</p>
<p>Treating everyone equally, irrespective of their (type and scope of) contribution, creates system collapse. This is what is also preventing DAOs from scaling.</p>

<p class="scolor2 b-ws-top">Thought trigger: Imagine the journey of Tesla, if it was built using a single-layer consensus driven DAO. It will start failing apart at the nth participant. Think about the likely value of n.</p>
<!-- <p class="b-ws-top">Absence of high-capacity decision making, restricts their relevant market size.<a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisBlec/status/1331334704793088003">And they end up being relegated.</a></p> -->
<p class="b-ws-top">This essay is an attempt to explore the issues (if solved) would create the next version of DAOs.</p>
<h3 class="b-ws-top">1. Single layered decision-making</h3>
<p>Not all decisions in an org are the <a href="https://i.imgur.com/92dXlt4.png">same</a>. They do not need to incur the same cost.</p>

<!-- <p>If the purpose of an organization is value maximization; that requires accurate decision-making at every level.</p> -->
<p>Visualizing an org as a decision tree:</p>

<img src="{{site.url}}/assets/img/org-tree.jpg" class="m-ws-bottom">

<p>If a decision that is solvable by a node at depth 4, should not need to travel to depth 1 where a general consensus would be invoked to solve it.</p>

<p>A possible solution is a multi-layer architecture. Perhaps, that would be true-er decentralization.</p>

<p>Interesting permutations are starting to emerge here:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet m-ws-bottom"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Are we seeing a dominant governance system emerging in crypto?<br /><br />The hybrid with 2 governing bodies, a Board and a Token community is present in several places, including <a href="https://twitter.com/substrate_io?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@substrate_io</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ethereum?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ethereum</a> DAOs. <a href="https://twitter.com/aavegotchi?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@aavegotchi</a>, #7 on <a href="https://t.co/s4S2fUrErh">https://t.co/s4S2fUrErh</a> by AUM is using this system 1/ <a href="https://t.co/86lKyUyqpa">pic.twitter.com/86lKyUyqpa</a></p>&mdash; DeepDAO (@DeepDAO_io) <a href="https://twitter.com/DeepDAO_io/status/1325792319623352321?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 9, 2020</a></blockquote>

<p>However, they are not enough. The problem is much more core.</p>

<h3 class="b-ws-top">2. Consensus-only decision making</h3>

<p>Consensus is a sub-optimal decision making process. It has its usecases, but isn't the gospel that is taken to be. Why?</p>

<!-- <p>Airdrops, liquidity mining, and every other token ‘giving’ idea creates a class of entitled mobs that don’t have much to offer but noise.</p> -->

</div>
<p class="b-ws-top">Democracies lead to politics. Politics shift the winning strategy from truth seeking (and enterprise) to narrative building.</p>

<p>In democracies the loudest voice wins; not the truest.</p>

<!-- <p class="m-ws-top">
Decision making is not an entitlement. It’s a reward for good judgement. Treating it otherwise creates mobs. Mobs don’t create value. </p>
 -->
<p>While value-creation requires innovation, taking a risk and being right. All of these are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AX4MKIDvXLM">individual pursuits</a>. Groups instead gravitate towards ideology, stability and survival.</p>
<p>
<p>Consensus has its place, but there also is a need to delegate majority decision-making to methods more suitable to enterprise. An idea is <a href="{{site.url}}/tavo#model">here.</p>
<!-- <p>Democracies create public goods. Public goods create a disincentive for risk-taking and breed politics.</p> -->

<p class="b-ws-top">Highly recommended read:</p>
<a href="https://twitter.com/verbine/status/1315959108684722176">
	<div class="callout hv b a b-ws-bottom"><h5>DAOs & Token-based Governance is a fantasy <small> | @verbine</small></h5></div></a>



<h3 class="b-ws-top">3. Lack of jurisdictions</h3>
<p>Governance without a power to enforce rules, is useless. In crypto systems, because identity is anonymized, the worst you can do is slash a bad actor's balance.</p>

<p>The problem is perhaps more core. The web2 methods of startup wealth creation, <a href="https://twitter.com/MapleLeafCap/status/1333661285624520706">aren't directly applicable</a> to web 3.</p>
<p>The idea of venture capital with company as its primary <a href="{{site.url}}/enterprise/">enterprise form</a> uses control, ownership and intellectual property to succeed.</p>
<p>While web3 uses community, decentralization and network effects as its moat.</p>

<p>If the <a href="https://twitter.com/naval/status/877467629308395521?lang=en">companies of tomorrow are going to be networks</a>, we do not know how to build them effeciently, yet. The optimal solution would require new thinking.</p><p>I reckon the solution would be radically less violent than what is available today.</p>

<p class="b-ws-bottom">Until then, there is perhaps <a href="https://lib.openlaw.io/web/default/template/bbllc-dao%20-%20vermont">a stop-gap solution.</a></p>
