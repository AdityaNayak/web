<p>Success of an org depends on its:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Decision Velocity</li>
  <li>Decision Accuracy</li>
  <li>Decision Bandwidth</li>
</ol>

<p>Increasing decentralization of decision-making as much as possible without it compromising the integrity of output; is a possible strategy.</p>

<p>DAOs are nowhere close.</p>

<h3 class="b-ws-top">Not decentralized</h3>

<p>If the purpose of an organization is value maximization; that requires accurate decision-making at every level.</p>

<p>This can be visualized as a decision tree:</p>

<p>Decentralized decision making would mean that the node at depth 4 is able to make the right decisions on its own.</p>

<p>Instead, in DAOs that decision load will travel all the way to depth 1 (aka centralization), where a general consensus will solve it.</p>

<p>Interesting permutations are starting to emerge here:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet m-ws-bottom"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Are we seeing a dominant governance system emerging in crypto?<br /><br />The hybrid with 2 governing bodies, a Board and a Token community is present in several places, including <a href="https://twitter.com/substrate_io?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@substrate_io</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ethereum?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ethereum</a> DAOs. <a href="https://twitter.com/aavegotchi?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@aavegotchi</a>, #7 on <a href="https://t.co/s4S2fUrErh">https://t.co/s4S2fUrErh</a> by AUM is using this system 1/ <a href="https://t.co/86lKyUyqpa">pic.twitter.com/86lKyUyqpa</a></p>&mdash; DeepDAO (@DeepDAO_io) <a href="https://twitter.com/DeepDAO_io/status/1325792319623352321?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 9, 2020</a></blockquote>

<p>However, they are not enough. The problem is much more core. The problem is:</p>

<h3 class="b-ws-top">Democracy</h3>

<p>Airdrops, liquidity mining, and every other token ‘giving’ idea creates a class of entitled mobs that don’t have much to offer but noise.</p>

<p class="m-ws-top">
Decision making is not an entitlement. It’s a reward for good judgement. Treating it otherwise creates mobs. Mobs don’t create value. </p>

<p>Democracies create public goods. Public goods create a disincentive for risk-taking and breed politics.</p>

<p>Politics shift the winning strategy from truth seeking (and enterprise) to narrative building.</p>

<p>In democracies, the loudest voice wins; not the truest.</p>
