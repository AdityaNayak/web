				Each team is structured as a seperate TAVO (except under Guild). We'll walk you through the process for both scenarios. 
				Starting a TAVO:
				1. Define its purpose and limits. 
				2. Define its rules of operation. Here is the current standard popular across the network.
					Joining, Ascending, Exiting.
				3. Fund the treasury with enough capital to ensure that the financial commitments that your TAVO makes to its future constituents will be met, in case of liquidation. 
				For eg. From the playbook v0.1 template:
				1. When you recruit, you commit to a 90 day project based commitment. The salary cost committed is your expsoure. This amount is locked onthe chain.  
				You could ofcourse tweak the playbook to negate this lockin.
				Capital allocation will be different from each TAVO based on (but not limited to) the onboarding and exiting procotols. However, collateralization ratio is fixed at 125%. That is, to recruit a team with an exposure of 100 SOCH, you'll need an treasury of 150 SOCH. 
				When the treasury value goes below the threshold, everyone in the team is informed and may continue with consent to the new reality. 
				Liquidating a TAVO
				Much like Moloch DAO, you can exit anytime and your funds that are not locked will be transferred to you.
