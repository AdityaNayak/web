At the Vantage Project, we got intrigued with the blockchain space last year and since then have been hacking together products that push its adoption forward. 
And one of the key recurring constraints we encountered ourselves and heard about incessantly from other blockchain entrepreneurs, is the bizarre dearth of good talent in the blockchain engineering space. 
And that had the “Problem digger” side of us intrigued. 

<p class="bkc">So, we set out to solve the problem. </p>

An easy and early awareness was that perhaps the problem in the blockchain space isn’t an outlier and perhaps, only an extension of the lack of “10x” engineers in the web 2.0 space. 

<blockquote class="dbc m-ws-bottom"> “Free education is abundant, all over the Internet. It's the desire to learn that's scarce.”
<cite>-Naval.</cite></blockquote>

And that became the Vantage with which we approached the problem. We choose to follow an Income Share agreement (ISA) model, for it is the most aligned to an win-win outcome. However unlike other ISA programs, we saw disproportionate yield (proxy for productivity) in attaining the right state of mind and hence, put disproportionate focus on it. 

> The critical constraint is state of mind. For skill is only an outcome and it follows.


##### TLDR;
<div class="">Achieved early scale (small) success. With first 3 engineers graduated and placed.</div>
<div class="s-ws-top"><span class="bkc">Input:</span>Any 1+ year experienced full-stack engineer with the right state of mind</div>
<div class="m-ws-bottom"><span class="bkc">Output:</span> Avg 2x increase in income to $3000 per developer per month. <br> Remote + Option join another team when you so choose.</div>


### Here is how we did it


#### Variable 1: Market (for engineers)
We chose India as our testing pad. Here is why:

<ul class="naked">
	<li>
		<div class="bkc">1. Opportunity to get in early.</div>
		<p class="s">This is an outcome of our internal thesis that the next large wave of blockchain adoption is going to come from the Indian market. Both on demand and supply side.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<div class="bkc">2. Abundant talent available at arbitrage rates.</div>
		<p class="s">Average salaries are still $20k and there are new 1.5 million engineers added every year. Assuming only the top 1% of them as the ones with potential, that makes for a seriously big number.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<div class="bkc">3. Familiarity with the space</div>
		<p class="s">We have built, exited and scaled multiple businesses in this market and have an easy vantage on its dynamics.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

#### Variable 2: Awareness on Success

We defined the ideal output we would like i.e. Attributes of the ideal 10x engineer and setup tests to identify the largest possible input set.


##### State of mind

<ul class="naked">
	<li>
		<div class="bkc">1. Desire for self-growth</div>
		<p class="s">Problem solving is the most underrated yet, most valuable skill set.</p>
		<p class="s"><span class="bkc">Indicators used:</span> Instances from other areas in life where they were stuck and were able to cause a delta.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<div class="bkc">2. Sincerity</div>
		<p class="s">An ideal engineer should only make a dent in your pocket, not your mindspace. Leaving you to focus on enlarging the pie.</p>
		<p class="s"><span class="bkc">Indicators used:</span> The instances where a choice to Listen / where a choice to talk was chosen. Insincerity in words is the easiest pit to spot.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<div class="bkc">3. Beginner's Learning mindset</div>
		<p class="s">Highest momentum for progress occurs when it is led by the human quest for curiosity.</p>
		<p class="s"><span class="bkc">Indicators used:</span> Identify the choice made in the event when an constraint is believed. A choice to accept the current state vs the choice to venture into the unknown to discover the complete set of all that is possible, is an indicator.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

##### Skill


<ul class="naked">
	<li>
		<div class="bkc">1. Programming</div>
		<p class="s">Great at recognizing patterns over different languages/frameworks/programming styles through significant practical experience. 
</p>
		<!-- <p class="s"><span class="bkc">Indicators used:</span> Instances from other areas in life where they were stuck and were able to cause a delta.</p> -->
	</li>
	<li>
		<div class="bkc">2. Systems Thinking</div>
		<p class="s nm">Ability to zoom out and look at the whole picture.</p>
		<p class="s">Ability to zoom in and fix root cause of problems. </p>
		<!-- <p class="s"><span class="bkc">Indicators used:</span> The instances where a choice to Listen / where a choice to talk was chosen. Insincerity in words is the easiest pit to spot.</p> -->
	</li>
	<li>
		<div class="bkc">3. Debugging</div>
		<p class="s">To know "the" problem is to know the solution.</p>
		<!-- <p class="s"><span class="bkc">Indicators used:</span> Identify the choice made in the event when an constraint is believed. A choice to accept the current state vs the choice to venture into the unknown to discover the complete set of all that is possible, is an indicator.</p> -->
	</li>
</ul>

#### Variable 3: Designing the process 
That Outputs the state of mind and skill that is mentioned above. <br> With Cycle time that’s tending downward <br> And Input size that’s tending upwards. 


Here is it's current version: 
##### Learn Skill (2 weeks)
Developers take a bet on themselves and go through an unpaid full-time on-location blockchain training school at our office in Delhi, India.
And follow <a href="#"> a curriculum</a> designed by some of the top block chain engineers.
##### Learn to Build (4 weeks)
Get into building mode and start to code products to be released to real and live users. They can also contribute to existing open source projects + build internal ideas.

##### Learn to Be (6 weeks) (runs in parallel)

Training for a State of mind was the most difficult yet, highest yield. The system is designed around 3 pillars and the onboarding for which occurs before joining the program:

<ul class="naked">
	<li>
		<div class="bkc">1. Discipline</div>
		<p class="s">Regular routine of 1 hours of meditation for the mind, 10+ hours of work and 1 hours for body fitness. Additionally, we follow a protocol of Ardh maun (अर्ध मौन) i.e. speak only when necessary. And that includes but is not limited to words utters to others.</p>
		<!-- <p class="s"><span class="bkc">Indicators used:</span> Instances from other areas in life where they were stuck and were able to cause a delta.</p> -->
	</li>
	<li>
		<div class="bkc">2. Initiative</div>
		<p class="s">Create a cycle of making every day better than your last. The parameters of success are for the students to choose and can change for every next day.</p>
		<!-- <p class="s"><span class="bkc">Indicators used:</span> The instances where a choice to Listen / where a choice to talk was chosen. Insincerity in words is the easiest pit to spot.</p> -->
	</li>
	<li>
		<div class="bkc">3. Service</div>
		<p class="s">Exist for others. Gain and exist in a state of empathy i.e. in the shoes of your team members and optimize for the win of the team.</p>
		<!-- <p class="s"><span class="bkc">Indicators used:</span> Identify the choice made in the event when an constraint is believed. A choice to accept the current state vs the choice to venture into the unknown to discover the complete set of all that is possible, is an indicator.</p> -->
	</li>
</ul>
A key tool here is meditation. We follow a similar model as <a href="https://www.dhamma.org/en-US/index">Vipassana</a> and the goal is to achieve a state of binary, on three specific variables; 
1. Mindfulness
2. Integrity
3. Empathy


##### After 6 weeks
They apply to join any of the currently running project teams at our <a href="https://www.thevantageproject.com/blockchain">Blockchain Labs</a> That also includes client projects. We like to keep all teams to under 5 members each.  

Current numbers:
Current input: 5 per batch
Value of output: $3000 per month per dev.
Current cycle time: 6 weeks

#### Variable 4: Solving Distribution
In process

#### Variable 5: Optimizing
In process

The key variables of the game are:
1. Rate of input
2. Value of output
3. Cycle time


### Help us Solve distribution
