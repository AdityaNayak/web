				      <blockquote>One answer is that a good founder doesn’t just have an idea, s/he has a bird’s eye view of the <b>idea maze</b>. Most of the time, end-users only see the solid path through the maze taken by one company. They don’t see the paths not taken by that company, and certainly don’t think much about all the dead companies that fell into various pits before reaching the customer. 
							</blockquote>
							<blockquote>A good founder is thus capable of anticipating which turns lead to treasure and which lead to certain death. A bad founder is just running to the entrance of (say) the “movies/music/filesharing/P2P” maze or the “photosharing” maze without any sense for the history of the industry, the players in the maze, the casualties of the past, and the technologies that are likely to move walls and change assumptions (Figure 1).
							</blockquote>
							<blockquote>
							In other words: a good idea map means a bird’s eye view of the idea maze, understanding all the permutations of the idea and the branching of the decision tree, gaming things out to the end of each scenario. Anyone can point out the entrance to the maze, but few can think through all the branches. 
							</blockquote>
							<blockquote>
							This is where the historical perspective and market research is key; a strong new plan for navigating the idea maze usually requires an obsession with the market, a unique insight from deep thought that others did not see, a hidden door.

				<p>Fund uses an innovative token swap to invest in TAVOs that get accepted into the guild.</p>
				<p>20% of partner's capital (upto $30k) of BUIDL tokens are transferred to the startup TAVO in exchange for 20% of its tokens. Guild serves as a Backer. Both tokens are locked for a 12 month period.</p>
				<p>BUIDL tokens can be used as collateral to borrow against. They can also be used to vote in the fund's decision-making.</p>
				<p>Purpose of the fund is to grow the value of its treasury by contributing to its constituent tokens' value.</p>
