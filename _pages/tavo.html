<h3>The game</h3>
<p>Business is an optimization problem of transforming resources into valued output.</p>
<p>Value requires optimal <b>decision making</b> (<a>not governance</a>) at 3 levels:</p>
<ul class="bold naked">
    <li><span class="dbc">|</span> Opportunity</li>
    <li><span class="bc">|</span> Strategy</li>
    <li><span class="bgc">|</span> Tactics</li>
</ul>
<p class="s-ws-top">TAVOs is designed to incentivize this optimization, recursively.</p>

</ul> -->
<h3 class="b-ws-top">Player modes</h3>
<p>Each player can choose a role best suited for them and play the game for their individual maximization.</p>
<img src="{{site.url}}/assets/img/time-capital-roles.jpg" class="img-h">
<p class="m-ws-top">There are 3 available roles:</p>
<ul>
    <li><h4>Partner</h4><p>Founder mindset - exclusivity + skin in the game (not just sweat)</p><p>Ideal for entrepreneurs.</p></li>
    <li><h4>Backer</h4><p>Investor mindset - status game + strategic value</p><p>Status game of power is replaced with consent. Similar to <a href="https://medium.com/@simondlr/the-moloch-dao-collapsing-the-firm-2a800b3aa2e7">Moloch.</a></p><p>Ideal for entrepreneur that made it, and now paying it forward.</p></li>
    <li><h4>Operator</h4><p>Problem solver mindset + mastery of a skill - permissioned existence</p><p>Ideal for the entrepreneurial mind seeking to <a href="https://twitter.com/naval/status/1002105081855016961">build muscle.</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p class="m-ws-top">Each role requires a different mix of capital and time contribution. The capital axis earns through asset appreciation and time axis through active cashflow.</p>
<p class="m-ws-top">TAVOs can also be public. In that case, there is an additional role:</p>
<ul>
    <li><h4>Investor</h4><p>Profit mindset - control + pragmatism</p><p>Serves the purpose of accurate price discovery of the TAVO's value and provides token liquidity.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="b-ws-top">Decision-making Model</h3>
<p><b>Consensus</b> is used for system-level decision making at layer 1 and layer 2.</p>
<p><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criteria_of_truth#Coherence">Coherence</a></b> is used for active decision making at layer 3.</p>
<p class="m-ws-top">Coherence affords players to make decisions in pursuit of the shared truth in runtime, achieved through mechanism design.</p>
<p>Modelling the mechanism rewards and costs on-chain, creates a (close to) trustless system.</p>
<!--<p>Good actions (not actors) are incentived through rewards that are linked to shared success.</p><p>Bad actions are disincentivized through slashing of staked equity and risk management.</p> -->
<p class="b-ws-top">Each TAVO has 3 layers of decision-making:</p>
<ul>
    <li><h4>Governance <small>| Layer 1</small></h4>
        <p>Decides on (but not limited to):</p>
        <ul><li>Charter</li>
            <ul><li>Purpose</li><li>Values</li><li>Limits</li></ul>
            <li>Idea map</li>
            <li>Token economic design</li>
            <li>Token minting and allocation</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="s-ws-top">Chosen by the partners when initializing the TAVO.</p>
        <p>Modified using consensus from backers + partners.</p>
        <p class="nm s-ws-top-p">Responsible for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Alignment to highest value path</li>
            <li>Risk management</li>
            <li>Enforcement of limits</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li class="b-ws-top"><h4>System Design <small>| Layer 2</small></h4>
        <p>Decides on (but not limited to):</p>
        <ul><li>Ascend framework</li><li>Operating methods</li><li>Joining + exiting criteria</li></ul>
        <p class="s-ws-top">Decided through consensus between partners</p>
        <p>Responsible for optimal mechanism design for operator layer.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="b-ws-top"><h4>Execution <small>| Layer 3</small></h4>
        <p>Decides on (but not limited to):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Critical constraint path</li>
            <li>Specific Knowledge</li>
            <li>Execution velocity</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="s-ws-top">Decided by each player using coherence. Sometimes led by a Partner.</p>
        <p>Responsible for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Bringing ideas to life</li>
            <li>Eliminating tactical ineffeciencies</li>
            <li>Flagging new potential idea mazes</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul> 
<p class="b-ws-top">Each TAVO has a strategy that is voted in by its members. <a href="https://medium.com/@simondlr/the-moloch-dao-collapsing-the-firm-2a800b3aa2e7">Like Moloch</a>, if anyone doesn’t agree with the chosen strategy, they can exit with their pool of funds.</p> 
<p>As a Partner, you get to patiently validate your 'view' using first principles, without making an attachment laden commitment to your idea.</p>
<p>As a Backer, you get to invest in strategies that seem high yield to you; instead of investing in teams and then taking the risk of an optimal strategy to emerge later.</p>
<p>As an Operator, you get to choose projects that have the highest probability of success (basis their transparent strategy); instead of having to chose basis coolness of ideas, or attachment to the team; and leaving success to serendipity.</p>
<p>TAVOs run on top of the main chain and inherit some base models on all 3 layers. Some of them are hard limits, others are suggestions. Complete list is here: <a>Network Playbook</a></p>
<h3 class="b-ws-top">Decision-making process</h3>
<p>Coming soon</p>
<h3 class="b-ws-top" id="init">Starting a TAVO</h3>
<p>Each TAVO is initialized when partner(s) get together to seek a shared truth.</p>
<h4 class="b-ws-top">Initializing</h4>
<p class="nm"><b>1. Idea:</b></p>
<p class="nm">This is the initial idea map of an opportunity of value creation. </p>
<p>This serves as the basis for coming together.</p>
<p class="nm"><b>2. Charter:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>Purpose: What does the TAVO aspire to achieve</li>
    <li>Values: What does the TAVO hold inalienable</li>
    <li>Limits: What is the TAVO unwilling to compromise on</li>
</ul>
<p class="nm"><b>3. Seed capital:</b></p>
<p>Each TAVO’s treasury must always be solvent. That is it can not have liabilities (including commitments made to operators and other stakeholders) greater than its assets. The first tranche is contributed by the Partners.</p>
<h4 class="b-ws-top">Compiling</h4>
<p class="nm"><b>4. Invite Backers</b></p>
<p class="nm">This is non-mandatory.</p>
<p>The choice of terms and process to use is for the partners to choose. </p>
<p class="nm"><b>5. Idea map</b></p>
<p>Collaborative ideation and then, consensus on opportunity being chased + year 1 strategy.</p>
<p>Any association from this point is with consent. That also implies that backers and partners can dissociate and take their remaining capital (like Moloch DAO) if they do not agree with the TAVO’s decision output.</p>
<p class="nm"><b>6. Playbook</b></p>
<!-- <p>Methods of operation</p> -->
<p>Ideal organsation is designed as a game, where operators work on quests to accomplish a specific goals (business objective) by choosing actions and experimenting along the way. As they make certain progress or achievements, they can earn <a href="https://mises.org/wire/why-we-need-profits">psychic (eg. badges and experience points) and economic profit</a>. Playbook is its documentation.</p>
<h4 class="b-ws-top">Deployement</h4>
<p>7. UBI starts</p>
<h3 class="b-ws-top">Why governance is overrated?</h3>
<p class="m-ws-top">To trigger a view: think corporate governance.</p>
<p>Wealth comes from creative pursuits.</p>
<p><b>Governance is not a creative pursuit.</b> Governance exists because a power paradigm (between the govern-ed and the govern-ors) is needed; to prevent bad actors from eroding the general trust in the system. Power, as is its nature, uses punitive methods to do so.</p>
<p>Such methods are significantly limited in crypto. Why:</p> 
<blockquote class="m-ws-bottom"><p>
“For example, you can’t say in cryptoeconomics, “It’s illegal to bribe people,” because there’s really no simple way to define what a bribe is. If someone really wants to bribe someone else, he can just go and do that outside of the protocol, and the protocol would have no way to tell.</p><p>
Whatever your rules are for rewarding, penalizing inside of the mechanism, they have to be specified as a piece of Solidity code, Viper code, whatever programming language you’re using in that set. That’s a much tighter constraint than policymakers writing laws have.</p><p>
Another one is, of course, that all of the actors are anonymous, and what that means in practice is that you cannot drag people’s utility down below zero. If I have 70 ether, and I put that 70 ether into a mechanism, the worst thing you can do to me is you can take away that 70 ether."</p>

<p class="m-ws-top">In the crypto world, these limitations free us to pursue non-violent methods of mechanism design.</p>
<h4 class="m-ws-top">Actions, not Actors.</h4>
<p>It is easy to see the game as made up of good and bad actors. This view is understandable given that we live in an identity/ego driven society. It may however, be untrue.</p>
<p>There are no good/bad actors; only good/bad actions. Each actor is capable of demonstrating both. Whatever action is more profitable (for the player) occurs. When it is congruent with the shared truth, it is called good; else bad. Usually, non-zero sum strategies create good outcomes and zero sum strategies, bad.</p>
<p class="m-ws-top">TAVOs use <b>incentive design to make it more profitable to be a good actor, than be a bad one.</b></p>
<div class="callout secondary">
    <p>Next 12 months are whitespace to iterate on this incentive design in production and get it right.</p>
</div>
<p>Some methods in the current idea pool:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Limits:</b> Used to screen new players, solicit consent and encourage self-responsibility. Any violation is leads to disassociation.</li>
    <li><b>Affordance:</b> for non-zero sum games only.</li>
    <li><b>Commitments:</b> are made at strategy level, not at TAVO level.</li>
    <li><b>Non-myopia:</b> All equity has a default and transparent lock-in period.</li>
    <li><b>Risk management:</b> Each strategy only gets allocated the amount of capital that is willing to be lost.</li>
    <li><b>Shared success:</b> All players earn a base income through UPI and the major share of income through a success payout.</li>
</ul>
