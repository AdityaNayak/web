<h3>Principle</h3>
<p>Value-first. Tooling later.</p>
<p>This would result in:</p>
<ol>
<li>Focus on speed of iteration, even if it is off-chain.</li>
<li>Once the experiment succeeds, move it on-chain and merge with the network</li>
</ol>
<!-- <p class="b-ws-top bold">What about the risk that an on-chain version may not be possible?</p>
<p>That's unlikely. Every interaction can be moved on-chain albeit with varied degree of trust. Worst-case scenario you'd need an Aragon court like system to maintain coherence between intent and action. Best case, its executed on the protocol layer. In due course, everything will be directly on-chain.</p> -->
<h3 class="b-ws-top">Timeline</h3>
<h4 class="m-ws-top">Q4 2020</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Initialize an off-chain instance of the network with TAVO + Guild.</li>
	<li>Setup the basic tooling and streamline operations.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="m-ws-top">Q1 2021</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Reach $100k of revenue flow through the network</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="m-ws-top">Q2 2021</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Initialize other TAVOs on the network, starting with Ecosystem fund TAVO.</li>
	<li>Move on-chain.</li>
	<li>Tokenize the first independent TAVO.</li>
</ul>
