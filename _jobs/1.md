<h5 class="m-ws-top">Our POV</h5>
For us design is about context, empathy and being invisible.

We know we are lacking in design at the moment, and that is where you come in. We are rehauling our complete product and attempting a radical model that is going to revolutionize the education space. Shhh.


<h5 class="m-ws-top">What you’ll be doing:</h5>

- Design UX for our product 2.0. Being able to output it in code, would be an additional bonus.

- Champion Usability inside the team. Regular audits + best practices for the engineering team would be ideal.

- Be responsible for setting a design system for the product. A good sense of visual/interaction design will be an added bonus.

- Own the customer experience and help teams see (and deliver) it as designed.

- Be data-driven and help measure usability of the product across flows.


<h5 class="m-ws-top">What you'll need to succeed here:</h5>

- A portfolio of work that shows your usability skills.

- Experience of having worked on a product that you are passionate about.

- Ability to use Sketch or Code.

- A sense of aesthetics.
