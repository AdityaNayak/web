            <h2 class="">Welcome to the TVP Playbook</h2>
            <p>We place disproportionate value on human potential. We see ourselves as a sports team (think football) i.e. built to win. We spend significant effort to scout, develop and cut to ensure champions in every position. All our teams are under 11 players, aligned to victory (not survival) and relentlessly focussed on promoting A-player potential.</p>
            <p class="bkc nm">Playbook is the framework that enables it.</p>
            <p class=" s">Current version: 1.1 | <a class="ibtn s" href="https://github.com/thevantageproject/web/commits/gh-pages/playbook/index.html">change log</a></p>
            
            <h4 class="m-ws-top">Guiding principle: Evolution</h4>
            <blockquote>“Freedom and nature, Smith concludes, are a surer guide to the creation of a harmonious, functioning society than the supposed reason of philosophers and visionaries.”
              <cite>-Adam Smith</cite></blockquote>

              <p class="nm">We strive towards the natural method of human behaviour. #reality</p>
              <p>And like evolution, we are an experiment in-progress.</p>

              <p>First principles of our culture:</p>

              <h5 class="nm">Trust</h5>
              <p><strong>Consistency:</strong> Unpredictability can not be trusted and only fuels doubt. We strive towards a principle based decision making. Playbook is an attempt in that direction.</p>

              <p><strong>Reciprocity:</strong> If performance and reward do not share a direct correlation and/or need a subjective opinion based evaluation, then it isn’t performance that is served.</p>

              <h5 class="nm">Care</h5>
              <p>We value ourselves enough to care where and how we spend our time. We look for people that have an insatiable appetite for self-growth and are not okay with existing.</p>
              <p>We will always only take limited period bets on people and every moment from that point on will only be to help the individual succeed.</p>

              <h5 class="nm">Growth</h5>
              <p>Motion is not progress. Progress is non-trivial.</p>
              <p>Our primary intent is to enable an environment condusive to personal growth. You will find traces of this state of mind, all over the playbook.</p>

              <h5 class="nm">Impact</h5>
              <p>We perform better when we feel a part of something bigger than ourselves. We seek to offer that feeling to everybody.</p>
              
<!--               <h5 class="nm">Psychological Safety</h5>
              <p class="nm"><strong>Shit happens.</strong></p>
              <p>We seek to enable a culture that uses it and gets moving.</p>
              <p>The moment of failure is also an opportunity to learn something new. For clearly what you knew in the past, doesn’t work anymore. :) </p>
              <blockquote>Why take stress, when you can take action instead.</blockquote>
            -->
              <!-- <p><strong>Not being afraid to be punished if you make a mistake.</p>
              Here is the framework we’ll enable for this. 
              1x failure. 
              As long as the cost of failure = 1x your quarterly base, failure is acceptable. Size your risks proportionately.

              <p>How to size your cost of failure?</p> 
              Delay * Business outcome (in terms of run-rate (delta money / day)) is a crude way of sizing the risk.
              Generally for a 1x win, a 7-day delay in an non-interdependent project will hit that threshold.

            <h2 class="s-ws-top">Integrity</h2>
            <p class="nm bkc bold">Are you really living "your" life, or merely executing your learned behaviours (pre-dispositions)?</p>
            <p>What is you (i.e. your truth) cannot be acquired, it is already within. What you need to get to it, is to drop the ego. All fears, insecurities, delusions, hope i.e. all expectations from the universe to behave at your whim. For perhaps, these are merely attributes of the identity of the person that you think you are in your head. In reality, you are limitless.</p> 
            <p class="s-ws-top bkc nm">Integrity != Honesty</p>
            <p class="bkc">Integrity == Your truth in this moment</p>
            <h5 class="nm">Your</h5> 
            <p class="nm">You are not your fear, insecurities; neither are you your hopes and delusions. You are what remains sans them.</p>
            <p>Choose your consciousness (self) and not the blindness of your predispositions.</p>

            <h5 class="nm">Truth</h5>
            <p>To see reality as is, not as you want it to be.</p>
            <p>With that perspective, everything external stops being good or bad; it just is. A mere data point. And that frees the mind to focus on appropriate action, instead of indulging in reaction.</p>

            <h5 class="nm">In the moment</h5>
            <p>The past exists only within your memory, the future is confined to your dreams. The only place truth can exist in is in this
            moment.</p>
            <p>Have the ability to be whatever you choose to be in this moment, irrespective of whatever the moment last was.</p>
            <h4 class="m-ws-top">Integrity in action</h4>
            <blockquote>Don't confuse what you wish were true with what is really true.<cite>Ray Dalio</cite></blockquote>
            <p>To do (choose) what is appropriate for the moment, not what you "want" to be appropriate instead.</p>
            <p>For that "want" is perhaps inaccurate until it is an awareness i.e. it is not a reaction but a response. 
            An example of commonly accepted yet inaccurate "want" is when at the time of committing to deliver an outcome, the choice of doing your best is made.</p>
            <blockquote>Ask: Can you deliver X outcome by Y time?<br>
            Response: I will do my best</blockquote>
            <p>Now, they may appear the same at the moment; but that can't be farther from the truth. The former is about the outcome, and the latter all about the ego.</p>
            <p>Instead, the true version of the moment may be spent finding the path to victory, not indulging in a path that is known to be not. The latter is only an attempt to satiate the desire to appear congruent.</p>
            <p>Drop the ego and salvate with service.</p>

            <h5 class="m-ws-top" >What would be the truth of this moment?</h5>
            <img src="{{site.url}}/assets/img/bellcurve.png" class="s-ws-top">
            <p>In this moment:</p>
            <p>My truth (as the voice), is to mellow this thought enough to be accessible to the largest size of market that TVP needs.</p>
            <p>Your truth (as the listener) may be to be here with your binary mindspace. Conscious. For that is a precursor for any self-growth to occur. </p>
            <p class="bkc nm">Spend time living the words here, not merely reading them.</p>
            <p>The playbook shall strive for affording its ease, by reducing content overload and focusing on just what you may need to perform.</p>

            <h4 class="m-ws-top">Why is integrity the chosen motivator?</h4>
            <p>TLDR: For it's the reality, of why individuals do what they do.</p>
            <p>Long form: For nothing else comes close to the kind of drive that it generates. It = your truth. There is no global truth, there is only subjective truth. Anything that an individual "desire"s and in due course "becomes", occurs. The only time it doesn't, is when the desire is not "true" enough. For you can't intellectualize your truth, you can't convince yourself of it, neither can you borrow it from externalities (i.e. morality). Your truth may only be discovered; within. And we are all, at best tending towards our (true) "self"s, albiet at different levels of efficiency.</p>
            <p>Be here, only when we are your truth.</p>

            <p class="nm">Be present in the moment, don't offer ego/identity in your place instead.</p>
            <p>A simple hack to achieve this is to view life in third person (TPP), instead of first person (FPP). Don’t make the game about what you want to do. Instead, make it about what is appropriate. Play to win the game, not make the avatar your identity. Fight for truth, not ego.</p>

            <h5 class="nm s-ws-top-p">2. Ownership</h5>
            <p class="nm">Be aligned to the problem and none other. You think it, live it, exist it. For seeing the problem completely, is the solution itself.</p>
            <p>Live life as if it's your own time that's at stake. For it really is.</p> 
            <p>Sincerity is not ownership. Exactly how motion (effort) is not progress. </p>
            <h5 class=" s-ws-top-p">3. Overcoming learned helplessness</h5>
            <blockquote>We can not solve our problems with the same level of thinking that created them</blockquote>
            <p>Problems (and hence your limits) aren’t externally created. They are merely realities/possibilities that appear "problematic" from the current POV.</p>
            <p>Noun vs Verb. The latter is liberation. The former is identity and limiting.</p>

              <blockquote>It doesn't make sense to hire smart people and tell them what to do; we hire smart people so they can tell us what to do.<cite>Steve Jobs</cite></blockquote>
              <p>We look for <a href="#aplayer" class="ibtn">A-players</a>. We see ourselves as a sports team, always playing to win. And scout and nurture for the next future Messi/Ronaldo/< insert a player that inspires you >. </p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>We understand that a job search/switch is a strenous process. We want to make it as swift and predictable as possible.</li>
                <li>The process is designed to reach a successful conclusion within 2 weeks. And ever candidate we talk to is given closure. That's the least we think we can do.</li>
                <li>We don't do JDs. Instead you will find us talking about the kind of problems you'd be working on here.</li>
              </ul>
              <h5 class="nm">1. Scouting</h5>
              <p>Our scouts are always on the look out. When something catches their eye that demonstrates that we might be a relevant spot in the universe for you, they will reach out and have a conversation.</p>
              <h5 class="nm">2. Establishing relevance</h5>
              <p>We like truth. The conversation will usually start with why we think you may be a good fit. And encourage you to apply for the role.</p>
              <h5 class="nm">3. Evaluation</h5>
              <p>This is where we assess current strengths and weaknesses in your skill set and cuture fit. This is usually done asynchronousy over emails, to give you ample mindspace to respond (and not react).</p>
              <h5 class="nm">4. First date</h5>
              <p>We don't like the word interview. Instead it is an oppurtunity to get to know each other, for the both of us. Please do come prepared with any questions that you may have for us.</p>
              <p>This is also when we'll extend a contingent offer, including specifics of the role. This for us both to get on the same page in terms of expectations. And help you make the decision easier.</p>
              <h5 class="nm">5. Meet the team</h5>
              <p>If you are actively considering us it would be wise to meet and work with the team for a day before you commit to a longer term engagement. This is that moment.</p>

              <p>Include but not limit to:</p>

              <p>Welcome aboard!</p>

              <h4 class="m-ws-top">Demystifying the Dotted Line</h4>
              <p>We seek to enable a culture of individual freedom, responsibility and growth. This approach is contrarian to labor law, that seeks to incentivize 'permanency' of jobs (over self-responsibility). Hence, we stay clear of it. Instead we (i.e. you and us) decide and commit to the terms of our engagement that 'we' choose and sign that into a contract. This applies for everyone in the team.</p>
              <p>Here is the contract we use: <a class="ibtn" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/11J0nJaAOqBjHGz4J0JK4b4cW-BGTOc31rpAWuJsjomI/edit">Contract Template</a></p>

              <p class="nm">Here is more on why we do so:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>We like to engage with each other as free self-responsible individuals, without a bureaucrat dictating what can and can not be done.</li>
                <li>You should only be here because you want to (be here), not because you 'have' to by some law.</li>
                <li>Similarily, it incentivizes us to create a culture that is enticing enough for everyone to stick together.</li>
                <li>The idea of permanancy is untrue. Impermanace is the true nature of the universe. And we respect that. We seek to attract individuals that reject this delusion.</li>
                <li>Do not expect a boss-employee relationship. We are all co-passengers on the same journey, albeit ephemeral (in the larger scheme of things).</li>
                <li>PS: This approach also translates into lower taxes for each individual.</li>
             </ul>

             <p class="nm">Here is what we do instead:</p>

              <p class="bkc bold nm s-ws-top-p">Affordance, not entitlement.</p>
              <p>Every individual's progress here occurs when (because) they have grown so much that it becomes stupid to not give them more responsibility. And for no other reason.</p>  
              <p>Focus all your energies on improving your competence. Don't bother with signalling effort.</p>
              
              <p class="">Here is how individuals ascend at TVP:</p>
              
              <h5 class="nm">Level 1: Autonomy <small class="bc">| Day 45</small></h5>
              <p class="bkc">Are you able to extract peak performance from yourself?</p>
              <p>Refer to the <a href="{{site.url}}/playbook#aplayer" class="ibtn">A-player framework</a>. A minimum score of 8 (out of 10) on each of the 5 attributes is needed to graduate. And for that to occur, you may start acting on it from day 0.</p>
              
              <h5 class="nm">Level 2: Leadership <small class="bc">| Day 180</small></h5>
              <p class="bkc">Are you able to extract peak performance from others?</p>
              <p>Leadership is a state of mind. We value the state of mind, not the identity of a being a "leader".</p>
              <p>Graduating to level 2 requires a minimum score of 8 (out of 10) on all attributes of being an A-leader + a successful outcome (that you owned) as an A-leader before Day 180.</p>
              
              <p class="bold bkc">What does it mean to be an A-leader:</p>

              <p class="s-ws-top">All teams start from the bottom most level, for only individuals have existed before this. Their combination as a cohesive unit aka team is a new, ever evolving and always unique (in its shape) construct that needs to be birthed. And then transitioned to peak performance. It takes leadership to get that to occur.</p>
              <p>And that requires channeling the common energy of the group to conquer the following issues in order:</p>

              <p>The only tools at a leaders disposal are empathy (not sympathy), affordance and inspiration. For the constraints of each individual and the collective unit become your constraints. You can't pretend they don't exist and yet, expect an outcome.</p>

              <p class="m-ws-top bold bkc">What makes a A-leader:</p>
              
              <p class="bold bkc nm">1. Self-transforming mind</p>
              <p>You are no longer held prisoner by your own identity. Your identity (and role) is constantly re-created basis what is appropriate for the team's win at the moment. And hence, can hold multiple thoughts and ideologies at once.</p>
              <p>Leadership is about serving others, without sacrificing yourself.</p>
              

              <p class="bkc bold nm">2. Self-responsible</p>
              <p>If you are angry or agitated, it's not 'their' fault. If your strategy failed, it's not because < insert a random external event >. The buck starts and stops at you.</p>
              
              <p class="bkc bold nm">3. Self-trainable</p>
              <p>Geniunelly willing to learn from others. Universe is always trying to show you the path, be listening. Listen to others and be able to arrive at what is a win-win for each situation.</p>

              <p class="bkc bold nm">4. Thinks in systems</p>
              <p> "This is happening because the incentives are set up that way". Most effecient incentives are rarely monetary in nature. Spend time to understand why humans do what they do. Recommended read: The Theory of Moral Sentiments by Adam Smith.</p>

              <ul>
                <li>A leader would focus on maxing out team productivity. Including but not limited to guiding their team towards implementing the operating principles ("Operating at TVP") in their lives.</li>
                <li>The path from (including) this level onwards is non-trivial. It's fine, take your time. You have time from day 45 to 180 to learn, fail, relearn and succeed.</li>
                <li>Qualifying for this level 2x's the base salary.</li>
              </ul>


            
              <h5 class="m-ws-top">Level 3: Junior Partner <small class="bc">| Day 360</small></h5>
              <p class="bkc">Are you able to lead and be responsible for (i.e. own) a business unit?</p>
              <ul>
                <li>You are responsible for the business case and success, of a part of the business. You have time from day 180 to 360 to learn, fail, relearn and succeed.</li>
                <li>Qualifying for this level 2x's the base salary with the incremental payout being in liquid tokenized stocks.</li>
                <li>A junior partner would focus on strategy for the quarter ahead.</li>
                <li>A 10x win here is needed to graduate.</li>
              </ul>

              <h5 class="m-ws-top">Level 4: Senior Partner <small class="bc">| Day 720</small></h5>
              <p class="bkc">Are you able to lead and be responsible for (i.e. own) a business?</p>
              <ul>
                <li>You are responsible for the success of a business. You have time from day 360 to 720 to learn, fail, relearn and succeed.</li>
                <li>You are the conscious keeper of the organisation.</li>
                <li>Qualifying for this level 2x's the base salary again with the incremental payout being in liquid tokenized stocks.</li>
                <li>A senior partner would focus on strategy 4 quarters ahead.</li>
              </ul>

              <h5 class="nm m-ws-top-p">How to take on an entreprenurial journey</h5>
              <p>Every business is designed to constantly explore new oppurtunities in their space of operations. They do so through experiments to validate new business oppurtunities i.e. 0 to 1 phase of the business. Each experiment is led by a Senior partner with a junior partner and an engineer. If and when an experiments succeeds, it is turned into business under TVP and scaled from 1 to 100. You can find yourself a place in that team.</p>

              <h5 class="nm s-ws-top-p">When there is a lateral hire</h5>

              <p>The risk exposure that the organisation undertakes stays constant and the time afforded to grow reduces for the individual on pro-rated. For there exists a reason why they are more valuable (and hence hired laterally), else our hiring has failed.</p>

              <p>Hence, fixed salaries become stakes and the higher you start with, the higher risk (and pressure) you take. Hence, we recommend you to focus on accurate price instead of a higher starting base for the sake of it, and then grow into your goal income in due course. </p>

              <p class="bkc bold nm">Dry run:</p>
              <p class="nm">Example org has level 1(autonomy) salary at 30k and level 2 (leadership) at 60k a month. The time exposure designed in the protocol is 6 months for an individual to grow from level 1 to 2. Hence, the risk allocated to the hire is 30k*6= 180k.</p>
              <p>When someone is hired laterally at level 2 at 60k a month, he has 180k/60k= 3months to succeed at level 2.</p>


              <h5 class="nm s-ws-top-p">Compensation principle</h5>
              <p>Our goal with salary is that it checks the box of "enough" for folks who are excited about working here (because of our mission, people and work) and then fades into the background.</p>
              <p>We follow a band based structure corresponding to each ascend level. The idea is to prevent salary from becoming a guessing game. Its simple and straight forward.</p>
              <p>Most critical roles (across all levels) are designed to have a "success" payout built in and would serve as the method to keep motivation sustained and pumping until you grow into the next level.</p>

              <h5 class="nm s-ws-top-p">How are 1:1 reviews done</h5>
              <p>By your team leader and as per the regular schedule. Hence, choose who you work with, based on whose leadership inspires you and where you are most likely to thrive. <a href="#operate" class="ibtn block">Deep dive</a></p>

            <p>Once the car is done, its characteristics and hence, scope isn’t in your control. The only place where you’d be able to impact change is in the process before it.</p>
            <p>This POV is similar to systems thinking. The latter helps in analysis and helps arrive at "why", the former is forward looking and helps arrive at "how to".
            <p><strong>Vantage:</strong> Whenever trying to understand how an outcome will be achieved, focus on seeing the process behind its current state (if it’s an optimization strategy) or seeing the process behind a similar or correlated outcome (if it’s an innovation strategy). In that vantage, you should be able to see the variables of the process and hence, its lever. You are now in control.</p>

            <h5 class="b-ws-top">(Micro level) Data tells. Listen to it and it will also tell you the path to your victory.</h5>
            <p class="nm bold bkc">1. What kind of data to look for: Ratios.</p>
            <p>Absolute numbers are a manager’s vanity, not a doers tool.</p>

            <p class="bkc nm bold">2. All processes occur in stages.</p>
            <p class="nm">A car production assembly is usually not one single line. It is divided between multiple sections like paintshop, body works, engine assembly etc. </p>
            <p>For simplification, assume this to be a straight line process where all sections work in series and none in parallel and hence, directly dependend on each other.</p>
            <p><strong>Vantage:</strong>Hence, identifying its stages can offer you control. What you can control, you can change.</p>

            <!-- <p>Even further within them, you can find key events of User Progress-ion and measure conversion between them. </p> -->

            <p class="bkc nm bold m-ws-top-p">How to know which events are user progress-ion and which are user motion?</p>
            <p>Every event that lies on the path towards creating revenue from the user is progress-ion. For every other vector isn’t progress. </p>
            <p class="nm bkc bold">How to find opportunities for growth once the funnel is ready? </p>
            <p>This is a skill that will build with time. </p>

            <h5 class="b-ws-top">Critical path is the shortest path</h5>
            <p>In the car assembly line, the maximum rate of production is = the lowest common rate of the all components. ONLY the lowest common rate.</p> 

<p>Hence, the input car part that is the slowest (most lagging) is what the final assembly out is going to be. All focus must always be to increase rate of production only that step. </p>

<p>In chemistry there exists a similar concept: Rate determining step.</p>

<p><strong>Vantage:</strong> Always focus on improving the rate determining step. Only. Until it isn’t one anymore. Then move the one that is the new rate determining step.</p>



<h5 class="b-ws-top">Innovation isn’t a project, it is an experiment.</h5>
<p>If you can’t see at least a path to the outcome, it is still an innovation problem. Projects don’t solve innovation problems. Experiments do. Experiments are designed to test the limits of failure, projects are designed to not fail.</p>

<p><strong>Vantage:</strong> Convert each innovation “project” into an operational one by doing enough experiments to gain vantage on how to reach the outcome.</p>

<p>For that ensures once a project is underway in the company, its victory is certain.</p>

          <p>If you are not happy, figure out why. Address it. It’s not our responsibility to add meaning to your life. Eventhough it is in our interest to do so. We use the tool of affordance, for that's the most we can do.</p>

Hence, we offer as much information as early as possible, for you to make an accurate decision. And we continue to create those affordances with multiple checkpoints (as part of your 1:1s) along the way. One each at day 45 and month 3.</p> 
          <p>And if you do reach awareness that we are not your ideal spot, no stress. We will still love you the same and wish to see you succeed in whatever you journey you take forward.</p>
