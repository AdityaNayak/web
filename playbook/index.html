            <h2 class="b-ws-top">Welcome to the TVP Playbook</h2>
            <p>We place disproportionate value on human potential. We see ourselves as a sports team (think football) i.e. built to win. We spend significant effort to scout, develop and cut to ensure champions in every position. All our teams are under 11 players, aligned to victory (not survival) and relentlessly focussed on promoting A-player potential.</p>
            <p class="bkc nm">Playbook is the framework that enables it.</p>
            <p class=" s">Current version: 1.1 | <a class="ibtn s2" href="https://github.com/thevantageproject/web/commits/gh-pages/playbook/index.html">change log</a></p>
            
            <h4 class="m-ws-top">Guiding principle: Evolution</h4>
            <blockquote>“Freedom and nature, Smith concludes, are a surer guide to the creation of a harmonious, functioning society than the supposed reason of philosophers and visionaries.”
              <cite>-Adam Smith</cite></blockquote>

              <p class="nm">We strive towards the natural method of human behaviour. #reality</p>
              <p>And like evolution, we are an experiment in-progress.</p>

              <p>First principles of our culture:</p>

              <h5 class="nm">Trust</h5>
              <p><strong>Consistency:</strong> Unpredictability can not be trusted and only fuels doubt. We strive towards a principle based decision making. Playbook is an attempt in that direction.</p>

              <p><strong>Reciprocity:</strong> If performance and reward do not share a direct correlation and/or need a subjective opinion based evaluation, then it isn’t performance that is served.</p>

              <h5 class="nm">Care</h5>
              <p>We value ourselves enough to care where and how we spend our time. We look for people that have an insatiable appetite for self-growth and are not okay with existing.</p>
              <p>We will always only take limited period bets on people and every moment from that point on will only be to help the individual succeed.</p>

              <h5 class="nm">Growth</h5>
              <p>Motion is not progress. Progress is non-trivial.</p>
              <p>Our primary intent is to enable an environment condusive to personal growth. You will find traces of this state of mind, all over the playbook.</p>

              <h5 class="nm">Impact</h5>
              <p>We perform better when we feel a part of something bigger than ourselves. We seek to offer that feeling to everybody.</p>
              
<!--               <h5 class="nm">Psychological Safety</h5>
              <p class="nm"><strong>Shit happens.</strong></p>
              <p>We seek to enable a culture that uses it and gets moving.</p>
              <p>The moment of failure is also an opportunity to learn something new. For clearly what you knew in the past, doesn’t work anymore. :) </p>
              <blockquote>Why take stress, when you can take action instead.</blockquote>
 -->
              <!-- <p><strong>Not being afraid to be punished if you make a mistake.</p>
              Here is the framework we’ll enable for this. 
              1x failure. 
              As long as the cost of failure = 1x your quarterly base, failure is acceptable. Size your risks proportionately.

              <p>How to size your cost of failure?</p> 
              Delay * Business outcome (in terms of run-rate (delta money / day)) is a crude way of sizing the risk.
              Generally for a 1x win, a 7-day delay in an non-interdependent project will hit that threshold.

                <h4 class="m-ws-top">How to update playbook</h4>
                <p>Make a PR on the <a href="https://github.com/thevantageproject/web/blob/gh-pages/playbook/index.html">gh-pages branch</a> proposing the change and the pricinple behind it. A discussion will follow. If and when a consensus is reached, it will be merged.</p>
                <p>We envisage this structure to be ever-evolving and would encourage you to contribute with your vantage.</p>

                <h2 class="m-ws-top">Integrity</h2>
                <p class="nm bkc bold">Are you really living "your" life, or merely executing your learned behaviours (pre-dispositions)?</p>
                <p>What is you (i.e. your truth) cannot be acquired, it is already within. What you need to get to it, is to drop the ego. All fears, insecurities, delusions, hope i.e. all expectations from the universe to behave at your whim. For perhaps, these are merely attributes of the identity of the person that you think you are in your head. In reality, you are limitless.</p> 
                <p class="s-ws-top bkc nm">Integrity != Honesty</p>
                <p class="bkc">Integrity == Your truth in this moment</p>
                <h5 class="nm">Your</h5> 
                <p class="nm">You are not your fear,
                insecurities; neither are you your
                hopes and delusions.
                You are what remains sans
                them.</p>
                <p>Choose your consciousness (self)
                and not the blindness of your
                predispositions.</p>

                <h5 class="nm">Truth</h5>
                <p>To see reality as is, not as you
                want it to be.</p>
                <p>With that perspective,
                everything external stops being good or
                bad; it just is. A mere data point.
                And that frees the mind to focus
                on appropriate action, instead of
                indulging in reaction.</p>

                <h5 class="nm">In the moment</h5>
                <p>The past exists only within your memory, the future is confined to your dreams. The only place
                truth can exist in is in this
                moment.</p>
                <p>Have the ability to be whatever
                you choose to be in this
                moment, irrespective of
                whatever the moment last was.</p>
                <h4 class="m-ws-top">Integrity in action</h4>
                <blockquote>Don't confuse what you wish were true with what is really true.<cite>Ray Dalio</cite></blockquote>
                <p>To do (choose) what is appropriate for the moment, not what you "want" to be appropriate instead.</p>
                <p>For that "want" is perhaps inaccurate until it is an awareness. 
                An example of commonly accepted yet inaccurate "want" is when at the time of committing to deliver an outcome, the choice of doing your best is made.</p>
                <blockquote>Ask: Can you deliver X outcome by Y time?<br>
                Response: I will do my best</blockquote>
                <p>Now, they may appear the same at the moment; but that can't be farther from the truth. The former is about the outcome, and the latter all about you.</p>
                <p>Instead, the true version of the moment may be spent finding the path to victory, not indulging in a path that is known to be not. </p>
                <p>Drop the ego and salvate with service.</p>

                <p>In this moment:</p>

                <p>Your truth (as the listener) may be to be here with your binary mindspace. Conscious. For that is a precursor for any self-growth to occur. </p>

                <p class="s-ws-top">Welcome aboard Sailor!</p>

                We expect everyone to be leading. For it isn’t followers that make a leader, but their truth.
                https://youtu.be/LH1bewTg-P4?t=1188

                <p>Take time and mindspace to understand the new environment. It's important that you ask questions if there is less than binary clarity on anything. It is likely that we have fallen short somewhere. Your mentor should be your first go-to point. You are also always free to reach out to any of the partners, or anyone you think may be of value.</p>
                <h5 class="s-ws-top">Strap on!</h5>
                <ol>
                  <li>It’s likely going to be overwhelming, let it. Watch fear(/delusion) and acknowledge it’s existence; then focus all your energies on action. As you progress, let it loose interest in you and thus, afford you your liberation.</li>
                  <li>The ask from you is to be familiar with this Playbook before you join</li>
                  <li>All structures discussed here are support structures to help you 10x. 
                    <ol>
                      <li>You will never be penalized or given a hard time for non-compliance.</li>
                      <li>At most, alignment with them is appreciated and encouraged. </li>
                      <li>The tool of choice (used here) is affordance.</li>

                <h4>Your first day</h4>
                <p>On your first day, we'll gift you a book recommended for you by the mentor who lead your evaluation during hiring. Meet your assigned mentor when you come in.</p>
                <p>We'll also help you setup with everythin g that you need. The intent is to get you upto 1x productivity in under 24 hours.</p>
                <p>Details: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/16654Q6dmLOEuxVHbvFVVbwo4Ezu6Xsve5SHGY2z7U_o/edit" class="btn">First day checklist</a></p>
                <h4 >Timeline</h4>
                <p>Principles for your path for the next 12 months. This timeline is indicative and to help you anchor.</p>
                <div class="bkc">Month 0 <small class="scolor2">end</small></div>
                <p>Check gate for you to re-evaluate our alignment. We'd stand by you, irrespective of whatever you choose.</p>
                <div class="bkc">Month 3 <small class="scolor2">end</small></div>
                <p>Reach a 100% track record of ETA. For details read ETA culture.</p>
                <div class="bkc">Month 6 <small class="scolor2">end</small></div>
                <p>Have successfully owned (and delivered) one 1x problem.</p>
                <div class="bkc">Month 12 <small class="scolor2">end</small></div>
                <p>Have successfully owned (and delivered) one 10x problem.</p>
                <h5>Daily Logs</h5>
                <p>We highly recommend a habit of maintaining daily logs i.e. a simple list of what you did today and what you are going to do tomorrow.</p>
                <p>This is for your own use to observe yourself. Think of it like your own personal version history.
                  <h5 class="s-ws-top">First 45 days</h5>
                  <p>For the first 45 days we'll actively hand hold you.<br>
                    You will follow 15 day sprint cycles (versus the usual 30). Starting a daily log is encouraged and shall serve as your guide rail.
                    <p>Your assigned mentor be available to help you observe yourself whenever appropriate and review your progress with each cycle. For most onboards, the first breakthrough occurs at this point.</p>
                    <h5 class="s-ws-top">Probationary Period</h5>
                    <p>The first 3 months.</p>
                    <p>A “probationary period” is a standard legal term required by labour law, but it’s really a space for us to ensure that we feel confident of our fit to you and are able to offer timely intervention. Benefits and Perks take effect once the period completes.</p>
                    <p>We want you to succeed and to become a full member of the team, as much as you do. The timeline is structured to enable us to work together to help you align with the team, to thrive and be happy in your new job.</p>
                    <h4 >Getting Paid</h4>
                    <p>All staff payments are made by the 5th of the month. We also follow another payment cycle around the 20th of the month, for vendor payments.</p>
            <!-- <h5>Payment Documents</h5>
            <p>Make sure the following documents are submitted at least 3 days before the first payment cycle.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Proof of Identity</li>
              <li>Proof of Residence/Address</li>
              <li>Permanent Account Number</li>
              <!-- <li>Your Bank Account Details</li> -->
              <!-- <li>Name on your bank account</li>
              <li>Account number</li>
              <li>IFSC code</li>
            </ul> -->
            <h5>Reimbursements</h5>
            <p>We follow a no-bureaucracy policy. And Instead have focused on fostering meritocracy i.e. correlating higher productivity to a higher payout for you. And hence, everything that increases your productivity funds its self.</p>
            <p>Any non-personal spend can be suggested on the #office channel on slack.</p>

            <p>Your assigned mentor shall be your first point of contact for all things non-specific.</p>

            <p>We do not discriminate based on any past characteristic. We only care about the value added, and the benchmark is the same for everyone, irrespective of their background.</p>

              <p>We recognize that our way of work may not be suited for everyone and hence, we offer as much information as possible and as early as possible, for you to make an accurate decision. And we continue to create those affordances with multiple checkpoints along the way. One each at day 45 and month 3.</p> 
              <p>We are determined to maintain the principle that you should only be here when this is your appropriate spot in the universe. Our intent is to make it easy for you to opt out anytime and find your ideal spot (if it isn't here then) where ever it is.</p>

              <div class="bkc">Digital footprint</div>
              <p>You will be assigned a company email account. You are to use that for creating all other work related accounts. No personal accounts to ever be used for work purposes.

              <h4 id="compensation" >Compensation</h4>
              <p>Our goal with salary is that it checks the box of "enough" for folks who are excited about working here (because of our mission, people and work) and then fades into the background.</p>

              <h4 id="timeoff">Taking time off</h4>
              <p>We want you to maintain a work life balance and take time off whenever you need, and ensure your colleagues do the same. If you notice that your colleague is working long hours over a sustained period and/or is agitated, you may suggest they cool off.</p>
              <p>We don't want to tell you how to manage your time, we trust you to do your best to maximize your productivity. Also, we'll let the guy who is trying to replace you, do so.</p>
              <p>You take less time off, there is a risk of burning burn out. You become lazy, and you can be beaten. Productivity is a skill that takes discipline, trial and initiative.</p>
              <div class="bkc">Communicating time off</div>
              <p>Communicate broadly when you will be away so other people can manage time efficiently, projects don't slip through the cracks, and so that you don't get bothered while away.</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Use <a>Timetastic</a> to request time off.</li>
                <li>The longer time off you're taking, the more advance notice you should give your team.</li>
                <li>A general rule of thumb is:
                  <ul class="s">
                    <li>A day off: a day's heads up.</li>
                    <li>More than 3 days: inform the previous week.</li>
                    <li>Extended vacations: a few weeks before</li>
