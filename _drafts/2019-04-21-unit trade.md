We'll get to the spolier right away; 
It's the idea of a Unit Trade. 





:) Now, that you have chosen to stay. Let's deep dive. 

**Definition: Any atomic process of your business that is able to map and encompass both cost of acquisition and revenue at a per user level.**

A high-level abstraction for it, in VC speak is "Unit Economics". Read more <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/unit-economics-is-growth-the-ultimate-goal-of-a-startup-b319df9c45f" target="_blank">here.</a>

The idea of unit trades however, demands a vantage point that is deeper, to include all campaigns, sub-campaigns and activities. 

<p class="note">With practice, the paradigm can also be extended to included each action. For the profit on the balance sheet is only the sum total of yield of each action taken at each moment, inside the company. <br>
And just because you can't see or measure them, doesn't mean that the correlation doesn't exist.</p>


And each activity that you do to acquire each extra customer, can be processified and can be viewed as a campaign. Let establish variance here:

1. A PPC campaign on google adwords that gets traffic on your landing page to generate signups and some of those leads then go onto buy your product at a x% rate of conversion, is a campaign. 
2. An activity of distributing pamplets to customers by hand to drive clicks to your page to drive sales, can also be a campaign. For it can be processfied. One person (on average, at scale) can deliver X phamplets. X phamplets drive Y clicks (as long as Y>0). Now you know, cost per resource and hence, you know the cost per click. 

The only difference between the two is of efficacy. 

There are 2 parts of the business. banana (building) and bechna (selling).
This may also include product building activities, with practice and better data attribution systems; for the purpose of the product is afford existence and improve the current state of the user acquisition process. 

At any given point of time, there are multiple unit trades occuring inside the company; most of them are unprofitable and subsidized by the ones that are profitable. The dominant side decides the fate of the company. (win/loss ratio)

Multiple profitable unit trades, compounded together create exponential growth. We'll get to it in a while.


We'll get to a specific example in due course. We will bookmark it here, the ask is that you access it after you have reached the section about compounding. 




Now that we have established the vantage (i.e. how to look at the problem), let's get into "what" to do with it. 

The simple goal is to increase the ratio of profitable/unprofitable unit trades. 


The process to get here would be:
Scout amongst currently visible patterns and currently possible (mined from existing data) ones.
This is a game of data intelligence.
If less than sufficient, experiment with new user acquisition ideas until you get to the first profitable one.
A game of DI + data attribution laywork.
Check for headroom and start converting it into a process until its rate is only a function of capital. For capital is the most fluid asset. 


This was the foundation layer for the magic to occur. 

The magic occurs because of compounding. More on it later.

Compound interest is the eighth natural wonder of the world and the most powerful thing I have ever encountered.
Albert Einstein

My wealth has come from a combination of living in America, some lucky genes, and compound interest.
Warren Buffett

Compounding short cycle profitable unit trades; creates 10x level exponential growth.

Difference. Let's se you were to sell a pencil today at 10% profit and a 30 day sales cycle. 
Without compounding, at the end of 1 year, you'd be at x.
With compounding, you'd be at y. 
That's the power of compounding.  



Excercise. We'll use a low hanging but sullied fruit to trigger your vantage. 
Let's deep dive into an example that would be easier to see, assuming you are a tech entrepreneur:

Let's take the example of X company
An example of a profitable unit trade for you could be:
PPC traffic from “linkedin resume builder” keyword
Resume imported from linkedin and once built gets uploaded on spring role automatically
Build a hook to replace the users primary social identity that is occupied by linkedin at the moment, with springrole’s
For you’ll not be able to beat it on its merit of network effect.
And the motive should be for him to choose to replace his primary professional identity (in email signatures etc.) with springrole’s

Average revenue per user should be on the lines of :
Annual: 80 inr (Reverse calculation from Linkedin India CPM numbers)
Assuming User to signup conversion: 30%
And sign up to active: 10%
Hence, a funnel that can be started with a click that’s < inr 2.6, is profitable; and can grow infinitely.

PS: The revenue referenced above would be unrealised at the moment, yet its reality is a simple function of when you choose to monetize.
And the growth till then is merely subsidized by external capital.
