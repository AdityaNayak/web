Running a campaign for your ICO is considerably different from running other kinds of marketing campaigns.
While any previous knowledge and experience will be helpful, the blockchain space has its own style and gimmicks.
Additionally, you should always keep in mind that while your marketing efforts are looking to raise a successful
ICO and promote your token, your primary focus should be your vision, product, and development.

## Choose your audience
Due to the current state of the crypto space and
ICOs, there are two ways to market your project.

The first one involves focusing on speculators and
opportunists looking for the next big break where
they can multiply their past cryptocurrency earnings.

The second one consists of putting together a
communication strategy that focuses on the product
you are developing, a strong community that stands
behind the project, and an image of trust and
credibility for your team and your project.

The first way may give you a better chance at raising
large sums quickly and with less effort. It may look
attractive initially, but it will almost certainly bring
problems in the future and may even jeopardize
your project. The second way takes more time and
demands much more work. However, it will also
allow you to reap long-term benefits and bring real
supporters and evangelizers even if challenges arise
in the future (i.e., a market crash).

We want to help you with the second option. For
this we recommend putting your marketing efforts
on steadily building a community, building a
relationship of trust with your team, and showing
what you can build. There is no better marketing
than providing real value to a community and having
the right kind of followers that organically generate
network effects.

## The marketing strategy
You should develop your plan around the value and
innovation the product brings to users. Remember
that the ICO is a vital tool to achieve project goals,
but it is not the end goal in itself.

Announcing an ICO is a useful tool for awareness
of the project, but it is not what should attract your
token holders. Every stage of your strategy should
be crafted to balance enough appeal to fulfill the
ICO sale objectives but also have token holders that
trust the product and are not just speculators.

Your marketing strategy should be developed to go
along the elements that we detailed in section 4.
Even if you are not able to fulfill all of these before
starting to market your ICO you should create a plan
as they will give you a lot of ideas to create content.

Overall, perhaps the most important aspect of
any successful marketing campaign is to keep the
community well informed about project updates
and developments. This will show transparency and
reinforce the credibility of your efforts. See the list
below for content ideas: (This can work as guides,
post, videos, podcast, etc.).

### Team
- Interviews to the founders
- Team members introduction and presentation of
their experience and achievements

### Product
- Analysis of the industry you are working in and the
problems it has
- Problems as opportunities and your solution
- Technology or innovation you are introducing
- Business potential of the project (market size,
growth, opportunities)
- Benefits for the users of the platform
- Prototypes/Demos of your product

### ICO
- Crowdsale details
- Partnerships
- Description of your token and its utility

### General
- AMA (Ask Me Anything) sessions for direct
community engagement
- Use cases of your platform

These are just some examples that will help you cover
the necessary information you need to communicate
your project but don’t be afraid to be creative and
try new stuff. After all, you know your project and
vision like no one else. The more engaging you can
be the better.

All of these creative ideas will need to get broadcasted
on a variety of channels. The most important is to
figure out where your most responsive audience is.
The best way to do this is to do some research before 
committing any resources. At some point, however,
you will need to do some testing to see what content
and distribution channels work best.

Below you can find a list of the channels that you can
use to promote your project and ICO with a brief
description of each. Some of these are traditional
digital marketing platforms while others have
developed thanks to the growing “ICO” industry

### Press:
PR is one of the hardest but most effective channels
as it allows you to reach massive audiences. Specific
blockchain news outlets tend to cover more projects
overall, but the industry has gone quite mainstream,
so tech news sites have been picking a lot of new
projects lately also. You can try to do this yourself
or hire specific PR agencies (although because of
demand they have become quite expensive).

### Public figures:
Connecting with influential people either in the
blockchain space or in your projects particular field
is good for credibility, reach and connections.

### Social media:
The great thing about social media is that you are in
control of all of it. Build a community where you can
connect with people and distribute all your content
and updates.

### Blog and YouTube:
Both these channels are perfect for long format
content where you can extend on all of the ideas we
posted above. Medium has also become the de-facto
blogging platform for blockchain projects.

### Community/messaging marketing:
The blockchain space has grown principally by
network effects and in the form of communities.
These develop in diverse ways - they can be open
platform communities/forums such as BitcoinTalk
or messaging channels like Telegram, Slack,
Discourse, or Rocket Chat.
Events, meetups, conferences, etc.
Same as community marketing but with the human
connection benefit!

### Bounty campaigns
Bounty campaigns are more a method than a
channel. Basically, you promise bounty rewards (to
be paid in your tokens post-ICO) for individuals to
promote your project and create content for you. If
you are not sure how to do this, you can find bounty
managers that can handle this for a fee.

### ICO announcement platforms
A lot of sites that list upcoming ICOs have broad
audiences. Getting listed on these will help you reach
an already existing audience. Be careful as some of
these platforms are more trustworthy than others.

### Paid advertising
Traditional paid advertising on different ad
platforms or topic related channels such as blogs or
YouTube channels.
