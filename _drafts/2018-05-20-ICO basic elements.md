Here are the building blocks of a complete ICO. Most investors will look for them and evaluate your strength across each. Hence, make sure you have them covered.


### Team
Who's the team behind the project. While not knowing Santoshi has worked for Bitcoin, it will not work for your project. 
Make sure you assemble a team (not just founders) that demonstrate capability to execute and deliver on your roadmap. That is what will 

Your goal is to 
Who’s involved in the project is probably the first
thing investors will look at when doing their due
diligence. Showing faces and experience go a long
way to building trust. While different projects
require different team members overall, you should
look to build a team that demonstrates technical
experience, business development capacity, and
knowledge of the blockchain space (both technical
and industry related). Open-source collaborations
is always a plus in the space!

### Advisory board
Any shortcomings from your core team should be
filled in with your advisors. This can be for technical
knowledge (it is hard to find experienced blockchain
developers, so advisors are incredibly useful),
or inside knowledge about the industry you are
building (i.e., if you are implementing blockchain
technology into the insurance industry somebody
with experience in that field would be very relevant).
Choose your advisors based on the value they can
add to your project rather than as “popular faces.” In
the long run, you will get much more out of them.

### White paper
(Position and yellow paper a plus)

Probably because the two most popular blockchains,
Bitcoin and Ethereum, were introduced with
whitepapers, this document has come to represent
a guarantee of credibility and seriousness. Although
not everyone agrees with this at the moment, having
a whitepaper that explains in depth how your project
will work is essential. The most serious investors
and the people that are interested in your platform
for reasons other than speculation will want to read
a whitepaper before investing.

#### Position paper: some projects release one before the technical
whitepaper. It is a clear 2– 3-page argument supported
by your technology proposal that helps get community
feedback to develop the technical whitepaper later on.
Yellow paper: The more sophisticated crypto/blockchain
companies will offer a Yellow paper, or a second “technical”
white paper. This one presents in scientific detail the
technology and the innovations that they have created, or
propose to create.

### Code and/or prototype
You may be great at communicating a vision, but
can you build it? Showing a good code repository, or
even better, a working prototype is one of the hardest
aspects to fulfill, but also the one that can make the
biggest difference. Currently, most ICOs raise funds
based on the promise of the product. Developing a
working prototype can deliver a huge advantage.

### Roadmap
If you decide to accept money you should also
provide a tool to help people hold you accountable.
This is one of the primary goals of the roadmap.
You should present the plan for the next years in
the project and share the most relevant milestones.
It’s also of critical importance to show the different
product version releases.

### Token sale terms
In addition to the platform and the utility of the
token, investors will want to know the terms of your
token sales. How much is being distributed and how
much will be kept, the duration of the sale, any soft
or hard caps and other mechanisms will impact
their interest.
