On-chain evidence of competence from past work here.
Distributed oracles

Participate in upside of the ecosystem: long-term games with long-term people -> enabled by this incentive structure.
Everyone gets tokens. 
Tokens get value from:

Seed equity/tokens in products that go viral.
Specific knowledge
That accrues within the ecosystem of hands on execution.
Network
Skills
Vantage
Psychological safety
Universal basic income

Day 0: a-player attributes + limits of engagement.
Day 45: tech skill demonstrated
Day 90: value demonstrated
