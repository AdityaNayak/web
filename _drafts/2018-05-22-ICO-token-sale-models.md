subhead: Out of all the variables in your ICO, the token sale model is the most crucial one to nail before you go live.

 For two important reasons: 
1. Designing an optimal structure is non-trivial process and will likely be a complex structure. 
2. The structure most be frozen before you go live, And any changes mid way are a serious dent to the credibility of the project.

The complexity of the optimal structure is also a function of the jurisdiction that you choose that may dictate limits including but not limited to who you can and cannot offer your tokens to.


Here are the popular token sale models that you should consider:

#### Limits
### 1. Uncapped 
Token sale is restricted by time and not raise amount. ICo finishes when the time period lapses and the there are no limits on the amount raised. 

### 2. Soft Caps
A limit (cap) to the fund raise exists but there will be more capital allowed after the cap is reached. The extended sale can either be time based or have a complementary hard cap. 

### 3. Hard Caps
There is only one limit. As and when the hard cap is met, the sale ends and the allocations are dispersed. This may also be paired with a time period limit. 

### 4. Hidden Caps
Caps are unknown at the start of the sale and are only revealed while the sale is underway. 


#### Token Price

### 5. Fixed Rate
Tokens are exchanged at a fixed rate against fiat or contributer tokens. 

### 6. Time based Fixed Rate
The rate is fixed against time of token sale. As the sale progresses, the rate changes. This can also be pegged to the sale amount.


### 7. Dutch auction
Bids are invited for all tokens and the price is sorted in decreasing order. When the total desired sale volume is met, the lowest bid is accepted as the price of the token and all accepted bidders pay that price. 

### 8. Reverse dutch auction
The token allocation is decided by the time lapse since the start of the sale. A way to implement this is a function where tokens grow less expensive over time.
Gnosis team used this method to get rid of FOMO thats common in most sales. 

### 9. Collect and Return
There exists a fixed cap but the sale doesn't end when the cap is met. Instead all contributions are accepted until the specified time lapses, at which point all contributions are used to determine their weight relative to total contribution. Total cap is allocated by that weight and the extra contributions are returned back to the respective contributers.

### 10. Dynamic Ceiling 
This is a non simplistic model where hard caps are set based on block intervals. There are limits on the maximum amount that can be contributed and thus, pushing whales to split their contributions.
