We'll get to the spolier right away; 
It's the idea of a Unit Trade. 

:) Let me deep dive. 

Definition: Any atomic process of your business that is able to map and encompass both cost of acquisition and revenue at a per user level.
Compounding short cycle profitable unit trades; creates 10x level exponential growth. 

A high-level abstraction for it, in VC speak is "Unit Economics". Read more <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/unit-economics-is-growth-the-ultimate-goal-of-a-startup-b319df9c45f" target="_blank">here.</a>

The idea of demands a vantage point that is deeper, to include all campaigns, sub-campaigns and activitie. 

* With practice, the paradigm can also be extended to included each action. For the profit on the balance sheet is only the sum total of yield of each action taken at each moment, inside the company. 
And just because you can't see or measure them, doesn't mean that the correlation doesn't exist. *


Let me demonstrate it with an example.

An example of a profitable unit trade for you could be:
PPC traffic from “linkedin resume builder” keyword
Resume imported from linkedin and once built gets uploaded on spring role automatically
Build a hook to replace the users primary social identity that is occupied by linkedin at the moment, with springrole’s
For you’ll not be able to beat it on its merit of network effect.
And the motive should be for him to choose to replace his primary professional identity (in email signatures etc.) with springrole’s

Average revenue per user should be on the lines of :
Annual: 80 inr (Reverse calculation from Linkedin India CPM numbers)
Assuming User to signup conversion: 30%
And sign up to active: 10%
Hence, a funnel that can be started with a click that’s < inr 2.6, is profitable; and can grow infinitely.

PS: The revenue referenced above would be unrealised at the moment, yet its reality is a simple function of when you choose to monetize.
And the growth till then is merely subsidized by external capital.

The variance in the possible variations of the first click are significant and may or may not include physical activities or non-scalable looking growth hacks. For every activity can be processified and is in competition with other methods. 


Multiple profitable unit trades, compounded together seem.


The process to get here would be:
Scout amongst currently visible patterns and currently possible (mined from existing data) ones.
This is a game of data intelligence.
If less than sufficient, experiment with new user acquisition ideas until you get to the first profitable one.
A game of DI + data attribution laywork.
Check for headroom and start converting it into a process until its rate is only a function of capital. For capital is the most fluid asset.
